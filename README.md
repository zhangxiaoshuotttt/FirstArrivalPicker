# FirstArrivalPicker
First Arrival Picker using U-Net: A collection of simple and efficient codes based on the U-Net architecture for accurately picking the first arrival (or first break) in prestack seismic data. These codes provide an automated and reliable solution for identifying the initial arrival time in seismic exploration.

While having some basic knowledge about deep neural networks may be helpful, in my tutorial, the main focus is on correctly installing the Python package. Initially, you can ignore the details of building the U-net. I will update the readme in the future to provide a clearer understanding for newcomers.
